First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for \"figuring it out\" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...

The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily.Only from reading, I understand that folks have had issues with the software.  GoPro, you have an edge right now, don't blow it because of crappy software, if you cant do it yourself partner with someone, but the software is probably more important than the hardware in making compelling 360 videos and 2D videos from 3D source.  Don't set the bar and then let others cross it because of inferior software.  Bite the bullet and just fix it.Amazon, I hope you are reading this, you would do buyers a great service if you could post a quick start guide for buyers and potential buyers, not a video for 360 fanboys, but a quick start guide for folks like me, who want to take immersive video while on vacation.  I will try to put together a quick guide over the next couple of weeks and post it, but Amazon, you stand to make lots of sales if you can show how the 80% of folks can get what they need from this camera by understanding 20% of its capabilities."},

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them)."},

This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost.This GoPro Fusion is a beast. The housing is 2-3 times larger than even the largest other GoPro models, the battery is about twice as large, and the camera requires two micro-SD cards to even function (one card for the forward-facing lens, and one card for the rear-facing lens). The files are also HUGE (more on that later). Thankfully though, even though the camera is physically much larger than any other GoPro before it, it still uses the same versatile mounts.The GoPro Fusion looks and feels like a camera that has potential, but GoPro has got to get better file compression and make the app/software integration better. I was totally unable to stitch and render any 360 video on my phone because of the massive space requirements, so I downloaded the Windows 10 desktop software. When I then tried to stitch and render a video of approximately 1.5 minutes in length, I could see that the resulting file would take hours to render (not including the time it'd take to then upload it later to YouTube) and would be nearly six gigabytes in size. To be clear, that's one huge video. This estimated size I was given for a 1.5 minute video with the GoPro Fusion was the same as the average rip of a 2-hour Blu-Ray video.The sheer size of the files that the GoPro Fusion produces and the fact that the computer horsepower required to stitch and render them is quite significant makes this a no-go for me. Unless you're going to stick to filming videos of only a few seconds in length, any videos that are a few minutes in length will require hours of your time. That's just too heavy of a commitment for me to have the latest/greatest in \"wow\" factor videos. I'd rather invest the time and money in full-frame video from a mirrorless camera or using another GoPro action cam.To be clear, this camera has awesome potential and the image quality is outstanding (it's an absolute game changer). But the technology is so cutting edge that I don't see this being a practical camera unless you're a pro or pro-am with hardcore hardware and a lot of time on your hands."},

The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with.I have never owned any GoPro before, I always preferred Sony action cams more.  I have to say this one is an excellent camera for 360 VR work.This is more of a professional workflow camera, if you just want to do quick 360 video or photo, get an Insta360 Nano S.  If your aspiring for more, get a Fusion.  The only drawbacks are, the audio really picks up even a slight breeze, and one of the sides has a more noticeable stitch line then the other.  Image wise, this one looks nice."},

Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.  This is clearly a known issue due to the number of times the connectivity problem appears in online gopro help forums, but there is simply no substantive help that works anywhere.  This is extremely frustrating - you spend time taking videos and you rely on the camera, and you cannot unload the footage without popping the cards out and unloading those - that is a much more complex method than on a normal gopro  or other digital camera. Very very frustrating for such an expensive camera."},

It appears as though GoPro has fixed their bugs at initial launch with some firmware patches.I think there is little understanding or documentation on how to use and edit these kinds of cameras, but if you have experience with stitching panoramas or editing in Adobe Premiere or Photoshop, you should be able to figure out how to use this camera within a few hours. Editing in 360 as well as their overcapture/reframe mode take about the same skill level.Pros:-The stitching in the software is almost always on point, there will always be imperfections, but for the most part, stitching at eye level viewing angles is consistent.-Multi axis stabilization (software based stabilization) is very impressive, and holds the camera angle in place (in my case I've noticed by default it points north at the horizon, regardless of  how you physically move the camera) which makes for great footage from a moving vehicle going over rough terrain (emulates human head movement) or while walking and unintentionally twisting/tilting camera. In low light you do get some strange blurring, so I cannot always recommend using it, but you can choose whether you need it after recording your video.-Battery life is good; usually doesn't run out of battery during a day's worth of casual use. Probably had the battery run down over an 8 hour period with about an hour's worth of clips taken-stitching software offers a lot of export modes, camera raw adjustments (for both video and photo)-voice recognition is pretty accurate, does not get a lot of false positives. Of course your friends will want to talk over you when you try to use voice commands-type C charging-editing in premiere with the provided plugins is surprisingly easy if you are experienced with premiere, not too difficult to learn if you are new to premiere. If you don't know how to edit in premiere, I think gopro's quik works with this camera, but I haven't tested it.-App works well (android) to preview shots in 360, and play back files from the camera before rendering. Its a little slow and sometimes a pain to connect to, but overall very usable.Cons-wake time is slow, takes about 10-15 seconds to start up, so it is not super convenient for the unexpected, but when it is powered on, it will start recording immediately-Price point is a bit steep. I'd say I got my money's worth, but for some, the price is steep-requires a lot of hard drive space on your computer, I would recommend having about 4 TB available to sandbox around with this camera. Premiere will need more swap disk space than normal-need a newer computer to edit video, especially when using the reframe function. Don't expect your 6 or 7 year old computer to play nicely with this camera. It kind of works on my 7 year old desktop, but I get a lot of errors in Premiere. Works flawlessly on my new laptop.-about every minute of raw footage is about 1 GB of video files before stitching, files get bigger after stitching.Conclusion:If you are in the market for a 360 camera, and don't have a serious budget constraint, I would pick this camera, as it is made and supported by an American company. There are some great low budget cameras that have similar specs on the market, but they are from relatively new Chinese companies, so I don't know if I trust them to support the camera long term, even though gopro has been struggling themselves."},

You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing.

Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be.

The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU.

First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for \"figuring it out\" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily.Only from reading, I understand that folks have had issues with the software.  GoPro, you have an edge right now, don't blow it because of crappy software, if you cant do it yourself partner with someone, but the software is probably more important than the hardware in making compelling 360 videos and 2D videos from 3D source.  Don't set the bar and then let others cross it because of inferior software.  Bite the bullet and just fix it.Amazon, I hope you are reading this, you would do buyers a great service if you could post a quick start guide for buyers and potential buyers, not a video for 360 fanboys, but a quick start guide for folks like me, who want to take immersive video while on vacation.  I will try to put together a quick guide over the next couple of weeks and post it, but Amazon, you stand to make lots of sales if you can show how the 80% of folks can get what they need from this camera by understanding 20% of its capabilities."},

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos.

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with.I have never owned any GoPro before, I always preferred Sony action cams more.  I have to say this one is an excellent camera for 360 VR work.This is more of a professional workflow camera, if you just want to do quick 360 video or photo, get an Insta360 Nano S.  If your aspiring for more, get a Fusion.  The only drawbacks are, the audio really picks up even a slight breeze, and one of the sides has a more noticeable stitch line then the other.  Image wise, this one looks nice."},

Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.  This is clearly a known issue due to the number of times the connectivity problem appears in online gopro help forums, but there is simply no substantive help that works anywhere.  This is extremely frustrating - you spend time taking videos and you rely on the camera, and you cannot unload the footage without popping the cards out and unloading those - that is a much more complex method than on a normal gopro  or other digital camera. Very very frustrating for such an expensive camera."},

I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion).

You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be.

This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost.This GoPro Fusion is a beast. The housing is 2-3 times larger than even the largest other GoPro models, the battery is about twice as large, and the camera requires two micro-SD cards to even function (one card for the forward-facing lens, and one card for the rear-facing lens). The files are also HUGE (more on that later). Thankfully though, even though the camera is physically much larger than any other GoPro before it, it still uses the same versatile mounts.The GoPro Fusion looks and feels like a camera that has potential, but GoPro has got to get better file compression and make the app/software integration better. I was totally unable to stitch and render any 360 video on my phone because of the massive space requirements, so I downloaded the Windows 10 desktop software. When I then tried to stitch and render a video of approximately 1.5 minutes in length, I could see that the resulting file would take hours to render (not including the time it'd take to then upload it later to YouTube) and would be nearly six gigabytes in size. To be clear, that's one huge video. This estimated size I was given for a 1.5 minute video with the GoPro Fusion was the same as the average rip of a 2-hour Blu-Ray video.The sheer size of the files that the GoPro Fusion produces and the fact that the computer horsepower required to stitch and render them is quite significant makes this a no-go for me. Unless you're going to stick to filming videos of only a few seconds in length, any videos that are a few minutes in length will require hours of your time. That's just too heavy of a commitment for me to have the latest/greatest in \"wow\" factor videos. I'd rather invest the time and money in full-frame video from a mirrorless camera or using another GoPro action cam.To be clear, this camera has awesome potential and the image quality is outstanding (it's an absolute game changer). But the technology is so cutting edge that I don't see this being a practical camera unless you're a pro or pro-am with hardcore hardware and a lot of time on your hands."},

This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them)."},

I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing.

I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage.

First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for \"figuring it out\" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily.Only from reading, I understand that folks have had issues with the software.  GoPro, you have an edge right now, don't blow it because of crappy software, if you cant do it yourself partner with someone, but the software is probably more important than the hardware in making compelling 360 videos and 2D videos from 3D source.  Don't set the bar and then let others cross it because of inferior software.  Bite the bullet and just fix it.Amazon, I hope you are reading this, you would do buyers a great service if you could post a quick start guide for buyers and potential buyers, not a video for 360 fanboys, but a quick start guide for folks like me, who want to take immersive video while on vacation.  I will try to put together a quick guide over the next couple of weeks and post it, but Amazon, you stand to make lots of sales if you can show how the 80% of folks can get what they need from this camera by understanding 20% of its capabilities."},

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with.I have never owned any GoPro before, I always preferred Sony action cams more.  I have to say this one is an excellent camera for 360 VR work.This is more of a professional workflow camera, if you just want to do quick 360 video or photo, get an Insta360 Nano S.  If your aspiring for more, get a Fusion.  The only drawbacks are, the audio really picks up even a slight breeze, and one of the sides has a more noticeable stitch line then the other.

I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion).

You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be.

This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost.This GoPro Fusion is a beast. The housing is 2-3 times larger than even the largest other GoPro models, the battery is about twice as large, and the camera requires two micro-SD cards to even function (one card for the forward-facing lens, and one card for the rear-facing lens). The files are also HUGE (more on that later). Thankfully though, even though the camera is physically much larger than any other GoPro before it, it still uses the same versatile mounts.The GoPro Fusion looks and feels like a camera that has potential, but GoPro has got to get better file compression and make the app/software integration better. I was totally unable to stitch and render any 360 video on my phone because of the massive space requirements, so I downloaded the Windows 10 desktop software. When I then tried to stitch and render a video of approximately 1.5 minutes in length, I could see that the resulting file would take hours to render (not including the time it'd take to then upload it later to YouTube) and would be nearly six gigabytes in size. To be clear, that's one huge video. This estimated size I was given for a 1.5 minute video with the GoPro Fusion was the same as the average rip of a 2-hour Blu-Ray video.The sheer size of the files that the GoPro Fusion produces and the fact that the computer horsepower required to stitch and render them is quite significant makes this a no-go for me. Unless you're going to stick to filming videos of only a few seconds in length, any videos that are a few minutes in length will require hours of your time. That's just too heavy of a commitment for me to have the latest/greatest in \"wow\" factor videos. I'd rather invest the time and money in full-frame video from a mirrorless camera or using another GoPro action cam.To be clear, this camera has awesome potential and the image quality is outstanding (it's an absolute game changer). But the technology is so cutting edge that I don't see this being a practical camera unless you're a pro or pro-am with hardcore hardware and a lot of time on your hands."},

This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them)."},

I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing.

I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage.

First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for \"figuring it out\" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily.Only from reading, I understand that folks have had issues with the software.  GoPro, you have an edge right now, don't blow it because of crappy software, if you cant do it yourself partner with someone, but the software is probably more important than the hardware in making compelling 360 videos and 2D videos from 3D source.  Don't set the bar and then let others cross it because of inferior software.  Bite the bullet and just fix it.Amazon, I hope you are reading this, you would do buyers a great service if you could post a quick start guide for buyers and potential buyers, not a video for 360 fanboys, but a quick start guide for folks like me, who want to take immersive video while on vacation.  I will try to put together a quick guide over the next couple of weeks and post it, but Amazon, you stand to make lots of sales if you can show how the 80% of folks can get what they need from this camera by understanding 20% of its capabilities."},

First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for \"figuring it out\" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily.Only from reading, I understand that folks have had issues with the software.  GoPro, you have an edge right now, don't blow it because of crappy software, if you cant do it yourself partner with someone, but the software is probably more important than the hardware in making compelling 360 videos and 2D videos from 3D source.  Don't set the bar and then let others cross it because of inferior software.  Bite the bullet and just fix it.Amazon, I hope you are reading this, you would do buyers a great service if you could post a quick start guide for buyers and potential buyers, not a video for 360 fanboys, but a quick start guide for folks like me, who want to take immersive video while on vacation.  I will try to put together a quick guide over the next couple of weeks and post it, but Amazon, you stand to make lots of sales if you can show how the 80% of folks can get what they need from this camera by understanding 20% of its capabilities."},

My initial thoughts are dated below:2/6/2018I caved in and bought a Fusion after watching a few sample videos online. I'm nowhere near as extreme as most of the people in GoPro's official videos, but I am an avid photographer that is interested in new methods. Prior to this the only 360 photos I had taken were either from an LG 360 Cam (which was okay for the price) and through Google Photosphere with a phone (which takes awhile to make). So far I've only used the Fusion for stills, and the results have been great for the most part. The biggest flaws in the photos tend to happen around the two endpoints that separate each lens, where you will see more blur and occasional stitch errors, especially when dealing with solid lines. Aside from that, picture quality is astonishing with RAW and even with JPEG.Another big thing to mention about this camera is connectivity with your devices: I'm often on the go and rely on my iPad or Android smartphone, so I have my options. What I've noticed is that each platform's GoPro app has problems that need to be addressed: iOS offers more support with many Apple devices and has the capability of sharing 360 video, but the app dropped connection often, the viewing of 360 content was difficult to focus on a single point, and there are some weird black and white lines that remain in the same spot on every photo; Android has very limited support for phones and doesn't allow sharing 360 video, but the app seemed to run better than the iOS version, didn't disconnect as much, and didn't have the black and white lines in the photos. I hope GoPro sorts this mess out for Android users as that is my primary device, and I will update my review when they do.2/15/2018Tried out some video recording on a roller coaster with the Fusion mounted on my wrist, but haven't been able to upload it yet due to the enormous estimated file sizes and lack of time . The preview looks fairly stable except when dealing with steep drops, but it's still usable. 360 audio sounds just as I experienced the ride, so that's great.Going back to the iOS and Android apps, I noticed that if you upload a 360 photo to Facebook with the iOS app, the black lines I mentioned earlier upload with it whereas the same photo uploaded via Android does not have the black lines. This is a little absurd, and adds to my gripes about the camera.4/30/2018I've been rather busy with this camera and finally got the time to try out the Fusion Studio desktop app... and you'll need A LOT of time. I wasn't expecting a fast render considering that I'm using my 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM, but the time it takes to render and the file sizes it makes are massive: for a 1:36 5.2K30 video (1 minute and 36 seconds) using the default Facebook settings, it took at least 20 minutes to reach 17% before I fell asleep and had a file size of 10.55GB in the end. There are other render settings to use for editing in Adobe Premiere, YouTube, or Vimeo that I haven't tried yet, but Facebook has the lowest settings so expect more time to do any of those other ones. On top of all this, you'll need a stellar internet upload speed to share these videos due to their huge file sizes (as of this writing my video has been trying to upload to Facebook for about 15 minutes at 75% completion). From what I've read is that Fusion Studio does a much better job at stitching than on the mobile app, but at the cost of much slower speeds.On the positive side, the video quality looks absolutely gorgeous. I have yet to try a night time video for the reasons listed above, and will update my review again when ready. I'd currently put this camera at 3.5 stars mainly for the software problems.5/21/2018The Android app recently got updated to include Overcapture editing. I tried it out with a 2 minute clip of me riding King Arthur Carrousel at Disneyland, and was slightly annoyed by the process. You start by framing your shot with either landscape or square video using your finger or gyroscope, press the record button, and make adjustments as the video plays. While this sounds simple enough, the framing part is executed poorly: I was not able to maintain a fixed frame as the video automatically slowly rotated. Using your finger to constantly adjust the frame makes the footage look jittery, so to compensate for both of these problems I stood up and spun my body with the rotations of the gyroscope to keep the footage roughly around where I wanted it to be. The end result has okay stability, but I know it could be a lot better if GoPro let us pick a fixed position that won\u2019t automatically move unless I tell it to."},

Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them)."},

This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost.This GoPro Fusion is a beast. The housing is 2-3 times larger than even the largest other GoPro models, the battery is about twice as large, and the camera requires two micro-SD cards to even function (one card for the forward-facing lens, and one card for the rear-facing lens). The files are also HUGE (more on that later). Thankfully though, even though the camera is physically much larger than any other GoPro before it, it still uses the same versatile mounts.The GoPro Fusion looks and feels like a camera that has potential, but GoPro has got to get better file compression and make the app/software integration better. I was totally unable to stitch and render any 360 video on my phone because of the massive space requirements, so I downloaded the Windows 10 desktop software. When I then tried to stitch and render a video of approximately 1.5 minutes in length, I could see that the resulting file would take hours to render (not including the time it'd take to then upload it later to YouTube) and would be nearly six gigabytes in size. To be clear, that's one huge video. This estimated size I was given for a 1.5 minute video with the GoPro Fusion was the same as the average rip of a 2-hour Blu-Ray video.The sheer size of the files that the GoPro Fusion produces and the fact that the computer horsepower required to stitch and render them is quite significant makes this a no-go for me. Unless you're going to stick to filming videos of only a few seconds in length, any videos that are a few minutes in length will require hours of your time. That's just too heavy of a commitment for me to have the latest/greatest in \"wow\" factor videos. I'd rather invest the time and money in full-frame video from a mirrorless camera or using another GoPro action cam.To be clear, this camera has awesome potential and the image quality is outstanding (it's an absolute game changer). But the technology is so cutting edge that I don't see this being a practical camera unless you're a pro or pro-am with hardcore hardware and a lot of time on your hands."},

The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with.I have never owned any GoPro before, I always preferred Sony action cams more.  I have to say this one is an excellent camera for 360 VR work.This is more of a professional workflow camera, if you just want to do quick 360 video or photo, get an Insta360 Nano S.  If your aspiring for more, get a Fusion.  The only drawbacks are, the audio really picks up even a slight breeze, and one of the sides has a more noticeable stitch line then the other.  Image wise, this one looks nice."},

Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.
